## Project Overview

This project, **Sperax**, is designed to perform blockchain-based token management and allowance checking. It provides features such as wallet connection, token tracking, historical data fetching, and token operations like transfer and approval. The goal of this project is to make it easy for users to manage their crypto assets and perform operations on the blockchain through a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Wallet Connection**: Allows users to connect their Metamask wallet or manually input their wallet address.
- **Token Watch List**: Users can add tokens to a watch list by entering contract addresses and track their token balances in real-time.
- **Historical Data**: Displays historical balance data for tokens based on a selected date range using the Covalent API (or similar).
- **Allowance Checking**: Users can check and manage their token allowances for smart contracts.
- **Token Operations**: Perform token transfers to other addresses and approve tokens for specific contracts.
